Development of triboelectricity-based pathogen blocking and inactivation technology
- MD (Molecular Dynamics) simulation and AFM (Atomic Force Microscope) analysis for surface characterization and electric field response analysis of pathogens (observation of pathogen behavior against external electric field)
- Development of materials that produce the maximum electric field through surface microstructure modification and verification of electric field intensity via FEM (Finite Element Method) simulation
- Optimization of pathogen inactivation device and verification of effects according to various mechanical energy sources (breathing, walking etc.)
