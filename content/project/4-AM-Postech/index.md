In implantable bioelectronics, which aim for semipermanent use of devices, biosafe energy sources and packaging materials to protect devices are essential elements. However, research so far has been conducted in a direction where they cannot coexist. Here, the development of capacitance-matched triboelectric implants driven is reported by ultrasound under 500 mW cmâˆ’2 safe intensity and realize a battery-free, miniatured, and wireless neurostimulator with full titanium (Ti) packaging. The triboelectric implant with high dielectric composite, which has ultralow output impedance, can efficiently deliver sufficient power to generate the stimulation pulse without an energy-storing battery, despite ultrasound attenuation due to the Ti, and has the highest energy transmission efficiency among those reported so far. In vivo study using a rat model demonstrated that the proposed device system is an effective solution for relieving urinary symptoms. These achievements provide a significant step toward permanently implantable devices for controlling human organs and treating various diseases.
