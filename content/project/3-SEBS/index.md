The growing demand for a new generation of battery-free implantable electronics necessitates sustainable wireless energy transfer technologies. Recently, ultrasound-driven triboelectric nanogenerators (US-TENGs) have emerged as an innovative solution for battery-free implantable electronics. However, an inadequate understanding of the triboelectric energy harvesting system in the body environment, and the lack of materials design based on that understanding, hinder progress toward sustainable energy sources. Through simulations and experimental investigations, we reveal that the electrical potential induced in US-TENGs is strongly influenced by the body environment and that the double-electrode mode is essential to achieve high current, generating 666% more than the single-electrode mode. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a flexible electrode with metal nanoparticles, which exhibit highly stable intermixing properties under ultrasound vibration, is essential for sustainable triboelectric energy generation. This technology can achieve not only acoustic power transfer but also sophisticated communication, enabling the generation of adjustable neurostimulation pulses without assistance from any other energy sources. The results demonstrate its potential as a sustainable energy source for versatile battery-free implantable electronics.
