I am currently a Postdoctral Fellow in Advanced Functional Polymers Center [(advisor: Dr. Yun Ho Kim)](https://sites.google.com/view/krict-polymer) at the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology. Before I join KRICT, I received a doctorate in Advanced Materials Science and Engineering from Sungkyunkwan University [(advisor: Prof. Sang-Woo Kim)](https://ehl.yonsei.ac.kr/). I have funding (**Sejong Science Fellowship**, Domestic Track, 5 years, 100,000,000 KRW/year â‰’ 72,000 USD/year), and **I can use this funding abroad for 1 year whenever I want**.

My primary interest lies in energy harvesting based on mechanical movement and its applications in biomedical engineering. I synthesize **biocompatible materials** for triboelectric and piezoelectric energy harvesting, primarily using them in **implantable medical devices**, such as those for neuromodulation, pain blocking, and wound healing. Additionally, I utilize these materials for **pathogen control**, employing electroporation to inactivate airborne and waterborne pathogens.
